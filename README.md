QPwEntropy
----------

QPwEntropy is a work-in-progress re-write of the Javascript zxcvbn in Qt/C++.

The project is very much in its infancy, and currently won't do very much.  In particular, batteries are not included - there are no dictionaries.  Also, the only thing the test program currently does is print out some estimated entropies for various parts of the test substrings.
